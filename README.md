# code-review guidelines
### Key points to check during code review of a class 
- **Use singleton in a smart way so it is well managed in multi thread**.

        public static class SingleTonClassHolder{
            public static MultyThreadSingleTon multyThreadSingleTon = new MultyThreadSingleTon();
        }
        
        public static MultyThreadSingleTon getInstance(){
                return SingleTonClassHolder.multyThreadSingleTon;
            }
        
- **Use static block to load any thing that is necessary to load during JVM loads the class in memory**.

        private static int count;
        
            static{
                // code in this static block will be executed when
                // the JVM loads the class into memory
                count =1;
            }
        
            public Counter(){
                //A constructor will be invoked when an instance of the
                //class is created, while the static block will be invoked when the JVM loads the corresponding class.
                count++;
            }
            
- **Java 8 has introduced *default* keyword which is susceptible to define method body inside interface**.

        public interface Interface1 {
        
            default void foo(){
                System.out.println("Interface1's foo");
            }
        }
        
- **If an interface contain only one abstract method then use @FunctionalInterface annotation.**

        @FunctionalInterface // that has one abstract method, so it will compile cleanly
        public interface AnnotationTest {
        
            abstract int foo();
        }

- **If 2 different interfaces contain method that has same name then it is called diamond problem and in that case we can use *super* *Interface1.super.method()* like this**.

        @Override
            public void foo() {
                //resolve the conflict manually by using the super keyword within the Diamond class to
                //explicitly mention which method definition to use:
                Interface1.super.foo();
            }
            
- **To initialize collections always use Interface type in this way**

        List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>()
        
- **Use isEmpty() to check list size**

        if (!myList.isEmpty()) {
            // dos something if the list is not empty
        }   
            
- **Use enhanced for loop rather using classic for loop**

        for(Person p: personList)  {
        // dos something
        } 
        
- **Use *Comparable* Interface to compare one object to other**

        public class Person implements Comparable<Person>{
        
            @Override
            public int compareTo(Person person) {
                if(this.getAge() > person.getAge() ){
                   return 1;
                }else if(this.getAge() < person.getAge()){
                    return -1;
                }
                else
                   return 0;
            }  
            
        }

- **compare(obj1, obj2) is the method of the *Comparator* interface that is called on some object to compare two other objects** 

        The Comparator interface is typically used for sorting data structures (such as Collections.sort or Arrays.sort).             
        
- **Use stream api on collections** (**filter the list of people who is upper or equal to age 50**)


        List<Person> olderList = new ArrayList<>();
        for(Person person: l ){
             if(person.getAge() >= 50){
                 olderList.add(person);
             }
        }
        olderList.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person.getAge()));


        // now using stream api to filter the list using one conditions
        olderList = l.stream()
                     .filter(p->p.getAge()>= 50)
                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
        olderList.stream().forEach(person -> System.out.println(person.getAge()));  
        
       
- **Lambda expression need to use on methods**

        ()-> {block statement} 
        
  **Example**:
         
        // without Lamda expression
        State state1 = new State(new OnStateChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public int onStateChange() {
                return 5;
            }
        });

        // with Lambda expression
        State state11 = new State(()-> {
            return 5;
        });  
        
- **Method reference in lambda expression**  
There are four types of method references (assuming a class named Person with **getName()** method and a value named **p of that type**)

|**Type**                                  | **Method Reference**        | **Lambda Expression**  | **Traditional**|
|---                                       |---                          | ---                    | ---            |
|Reference to a static method              |Math::square                 |n-> Math.square(n)      |void square(n)   {Math.square(n)}|            
|Reference to a constructor                |Capital::new                 |i-> new Capital(i)      |public Capital(i) { new Capital(i)}|
|Reference to an instance method           |Person::getName              |p-> p.getName()         |public String getName(Person p){p.getName()}|



- **Use Callable and Future with ExecutorService because Runnable does not return any value after execution.**


        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        //The Callable interface is similar to Runnable,
        // they're both designed to be executed by another thread,
        // a Runnable however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception.
        Callable c = () -> {

            int n=0;
            for (int i=0; i< 100; i++){n+= i;}
            return n;

        };


        Future<Long> future = executor.submit(c);
        try {

            Long result = future.get(); //waits for the thread to complete
            System.out.println(result);

        } catch (ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        
- We can use `Atomic` that support lock-free and thread-safe programming on single variables. Among them, the `AtomicInteger` class is a wrapper class for an int value that allows it to be updated atomically. 
        
        AtomicInteger at = new AtomicInteger(0); 
        
        
- It is a fairly common mistake by Java programmers to forget releasing resources, even in the finally
block.
  - Normally, a finally block is used to ensure that a resource is closed whether the try statement completes normally or not.
  
                BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
                try {
                    return br.readLine();
                } catch(IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                } finally {
                    if (br != null) br.close();
                }
                
 - However, Java 7 introduced the **try-with-resources statement**, which ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement  
 
                 try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
                        return br.readLine();
                    }
